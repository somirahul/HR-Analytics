In this freelance project, I successfully conducted comprehensive HR analytics using a combination of SQL, Excel, and Tableau. Here's a breakdown of the key tasks I performed:

Data Cleaning in Excel: I began by meticulously cleaning and preparing the HR dataset in Excel. This involved handling missing values, standardizing data formats, and ensuring data integrity.

Insights Generation with SQL: Using SQL, I executed complex queries and data transformations to extract valuable insights from the cleaned dataset. This included analyzing employee performance, turnover rates, and other HR-related metrics.

Interactive Visualization with Tableau: To make the HR insights more accessible and actionable, I leveraged Tableau to create interactive dashboards and visualizations. These interactive dashboards allowed stakeholders to explore the data, uncover trends, and gain deeper insights into HR-related aspects.

By combining these tools and techniques, I was able to provide a comprehensive HR analytics solution, enabling data-driven decision-making for the organization.

Feel free to explore the repository to see the data cleaning scripts, SQL queries, and the Tableau dashboards in action. Your feedback and suggestions are welcome!
